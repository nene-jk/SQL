#In this project, I downloaded a "Spotify top 50 songs in 2021" dataset from Kaggle in order to perform an analysis.

#I started off by creating a table to insert the Spotify data into:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
    id               INTEGER        PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name      VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    track_name       VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    track_id         VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    popularity       INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    danceability     DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    energy           DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    song_key         INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    loudness         DECIMAL (5, 3) NOT NULL,
    song_mode        INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    speechiness      DECIMAL (5, 4) NOT NULL,
    acousticness     DECIMAL (6, 5) NOT NULL,
    instrumentalness DECIMAL (8, 7) NOT NULL,
    liveness         DECIMAL (5, 4) NOT NULL,
    valence          DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    tempo            DECIMAL (6, 3) NOT NULL,
    duration_ms      INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    time_signature   INTEGER        NOT NULL
);

#Then I inserted the SpotifyData.csv into the table.

#Lastly, I explored the data to answer a few questions (listed below).

SELECT *
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#1. List the top 5 artists and tracks by popularity.
SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       popularity
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 ORDER BY popularity DESC
 LIMIT 5;

#2. What was the most song and artist was with the highest popularity? 
SELECT track_name,
       artist_name,
       MAX(popularity) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3. What was their avarage popularity?
SELECT artist_name,
       AVG(popularity) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 WHERE artist_name LIKE '%Olivia Rodrigo%';

#4. How many of the artist's song(s) made it onto Spotify's TOP 50 list?
SELECT count(track_name) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 WHERE artist_name LIKE '%Olivia Rodrigo%';

#5. What was the avarage duration of all of their songs?
SELECT artist_name,
       AVG(duration_ms) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#6. List the top 5 most danceable songs and their artists?
SELECT track_name,
       artist_name,
       MAX(danceability) danceability
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY artist_name
 ORDER BY danceability DESC
 LIMIT 5;

#7. Determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       avg(popularity),
       avg(danceability),
       avg(energy) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY artist_name;

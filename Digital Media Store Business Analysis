# In this project, I uploaded a csv file the contained data about a digital Media store called Chinook. 
# I then explored the database in order to conduct analysis on business performance. 

# First, I started off answering questions about the staff at the store to analyze employee performance. 

# 1. List all of the employees who are sales agents.
SELECT LastName,
       FirstName,
       Title
  FROM chinook.employees
 WHERE Title LIKE '%Support%';
 
# 2. Select the sales agent who has worked with the company for the longest. 
SELECT LastName,
      FirstName,
      Max(HireDate) 
 FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Support%';
 
# 3. How many customers has each of sales agent assisted?
SELECT employees.FirstName,
      employees.LastName,
      Count(CustomerID) TotalCustomers
 FROM chinook.employees employees
      JOIN
      chinook.customers customers ON employees.Employeeid = customers.SupportRepID
GROUP BY employees.LastName;
 
# 4. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName,
      emp.LastName,
      ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS [Total Sales]
 FROM chinook.Employees emp
      JOIN
      chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
      JOIN
      chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;
 
# Based on the answers from questions 2-4, it seems as though Steve Johnson has worked the longest as the company; however, he has assisted the 
 least amount of customers and have brought in the least in total sales. This might mean that he needs further training or a performance review to help
 boost his performance.
 
# Then, I dug deeper into some customer and order data to determine what areas of the business can be improved or 
 leveraged to build an effective growth strategy for the future.
 
# 5. List the total number of customers per country. 
SELECT Country,
      Count(CustomerId) TotalCustomers
 FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;
 
# It looks like U.S. has had the most amount of customers. This may be important information to look at for the marketing department. They may decide
 to focus their marketing/sales efforts and budget in the USA.
 
# 6. Show all of the customers from the USA. 
SELECT CustomerId,
      FirstName,
      LastName
 FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA';
 
# 7. Which US state had to most customers?
SELECT State,
       Count(CustomerId) TotalCustomers
  FROM chinook.customers

 GROUP BY state
 ORDER BY Count(state) DESC;

# 8. Which US state generated the highes total sales amount?
SELECT state,

       JOIN
       chinook.invoice_items items ON inv.invoiceId = items.invoiceId
 WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA'
 GROUP BY state
 ORDER BY sum(total) DESC;

# As this is the highest grossing state, it should be looked at as the key market for developing an effective business strategy (i.e. during the product
development strategies and coming up with pricing and expansion strategies.
 
# 9. What is the total sales amount generated in the USA overall?
SELECT SUM(total) AS [Total US Sales]
 FROM chinook.invoice_items items
      JOIN
      chinook.invoices invoices ON items.invoiceId = invoices.invoiceId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA';
 
# 10.  What was the total sales amount in the US for each year?
SELECT Round(SUM(total)) AS [Total Sales]
  FROM chinook.invoice_items items
       JOIN
       chinook.invoices invoices ON items.invoiceId = invoices.invoiceId
 WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA' AND

SELECT Round(SUM(total)) AS [Total Sales]
  FROM chinook.invoice_items items
       JOIN

SELECT Round(SUM(total)) AS [Total Sales]
  FROM chinook.invoice_items items
       JOIN

SELECT Round(SUM(total)) AS [Total Sales]
  FROM chinook.invoice_items items
       JOIN
       chinook.invoices invoices ON items.invoiceId = invoices.invoiceId
 WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA' AND 
       InvoiceDate LIKE '%2012%';

SELECT Round(SUM(total)) AS [Total Sales]
  FROM chinook.invoice_items items
       JOIN
       chinook.invoices invoices ON items.invoiceId = invoices.invoiceId
 WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA' AND 
       InvoiceDate LIKE '%2013%';

# Knowing the total sales generated for each year would be helpful in coming up with a business stragety to support growth in the next coming years. 
By creating a graph of each year's total sales, we will be able to identify any trends and forecast and future activities.

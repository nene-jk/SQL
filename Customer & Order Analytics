#In this SQL project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT( * ) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone' AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales Feb ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
 WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product,
       MIN(price) AS price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales AS Jan
  GROUP BY Product, price
 ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,
       ROUND(SUM(Quantity) * price) AS total_rev
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,
       SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity,
       SUM(Quantity) * price AS total_rev
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
 GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) AS num_of_cust,
       ROUND(AVG(Quantity * price) ) AS avg_spent
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
       LEFT JOIN
       BIT_DB.customers AS cust ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
 WHERE Quantity > 2 AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'ORDER ID';
